# Running-and-Fitness-Data

Data set taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/girardi69/marathon-time-predictions

A small project exploring some marathon times with the amount of time/miles spent training. To try to understand and plan how many miles I would need to run a sub 3 hour marathon.
The fitness data used in my running data notebook was taken from my training peaks account.
